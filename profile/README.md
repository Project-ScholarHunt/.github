## üéì ScholarHunt: A solution to overcome challenges in the scholarship application process in Indonesia

### 2. Inefficient & Costly Manual Processes

- **The process of sending and compiling documents by the committee can take several days or even weeks.**
- Physical documents are **prone to being lost, damaged, or misplaced** during delivery and storage, causing inconvenience to both applicants and the committee.

<br>

### 3. Lack of Transparency and Access to Information (Uncertainty of Status)

- Students often face **uncertainty**, not knowing whether their documents:
  - have been received,
  - are being verified,
  - or what the final outcome is.
- **It is difficult for students to track the progress of their application in a centralized manner.**
- Selection committees are burdened with manual data compilation tasks that are **prone to human error**, such as incorrect input of GPA or personal information.
